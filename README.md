From @rhdeck talk at Boston AI Meetup 8/29/2017
## Useful Links
### HDF5 Viewers
 - Panoply; https://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/panoply/ (Best for reading headers and getting charts from the stored data)
 - HDFView: https://support.hdfgroup.org/products/java/hdfview/index.html (Best for getting the raw numbers from the stored data)
### Protobuf Viewers
 - ProtobufViewer (MacOS): https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/protobuf-viewer/id1165908879?mt=12
 - Protobuf Editor (Windows): https://sourceforge.net/projects/protobufeditor/ (Requires .proto schema!)

### Prototxt Viewing
 - Netscope: https://ethereon.github.io/netscope Great for visualizing the graph in a caffe model. Can be ornery on the typing and style of the prototxt fed to it. Check out the presets!
### Zoos
### CoreML Resources
